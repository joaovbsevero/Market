# Market

This project is a POC to showcase the use of PyQt 5 capabilities. It currently supports an interface that allows the user to register products bought and sold, view historical data of profits, update old records and many more.

## Configuration

To run this POC, Python 3.6 is necessary (yes, this is a very old project). I recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) to setup this Python version.

Once Python 3.6 is configured, you should install the dependencies, a requirements.txt file is available to help out:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With all dependencies installed, now you can just run the application

## Running

To run the application, just execute the following command:

```sh
python -m market
```

It will popup a new window
